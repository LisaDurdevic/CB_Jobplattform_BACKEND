BACKEND PHP Interface, version 2, for the CB-JOBPLATTFORM project. use the db-file to import the sample db locally for testing the interface. or change the auth.inc.php data to another matching db.

open the index page and use the buttons to switch between the views and see the magic happening.

"CodeIgniter" is a first try on frameworks. Had to happen fast. Code is NOT complete.
