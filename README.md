BACKEND PHP Interface, version 2, for the CB-JOBPLATTFORM project. use the db-file to import the sample db locally for testing the interface. or change the auth.inc.php data to another matching db.

open the index page and use the buttons to switch between the views and see the magic happening.
The Code within "auth", "utils" and "views" belongs together and works.

"CodeIgniter" is a first try on frameworks. Had to happen fast for presentation. The code within codeIgniter is NOT complete.
